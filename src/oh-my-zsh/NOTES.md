## OS Support

This feature currently only supports Debian based containers (where APT is used as package manager).

`bash` is required to run the install script.

## Acknowledgements

This feature is based on the [zsh feature by Nils Geistmann](https://github.com/nils-geistmann/devcontainers-features/tree/main/src/zsh).
